This page is dedicated to the community resources that we use to collaborate and build together. Below you'll find links to helpful tools, templates, and other important resources that power our communityâ€™s operations.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is where all the magic happens. This is our community GitHub server, where you can access all the resources needed for digital operations, from project repositories to documentation and templates.

In fact, this very website is hosted on GitHub. You can find the source code for this website [here](). You can also help contribute to make it better!
