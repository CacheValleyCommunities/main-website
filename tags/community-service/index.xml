&lt;h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The &lt;strong>William A. Burnard (W.A.B.) Warming Center&lt;/strong> is dedicated to strengthening our community by offering warmth, safety, and care to unhoused individuals and families during the coldest months of the year in &lt;strong>Cache Valley, Utah&lt;/strong>. Our center is a sanctuary for those in need, providing a safe space to escape freezing temperatures and access critical resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-do-we-serve">Who Do We Serve?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The W.A.B. Warming Center serves &lt;strong>individuals and families&lt;/strong> experiencing homelessness. Families with children are welcome, but parents will need to sign an agreement that ensures their children will stay with them at all times during their visit. Volunteers and staff are on hand to offer friendly, active supervision while the center is in operation, ensuring the safety and well-being of all guests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-vision">Our Vision
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We believe in a community where &lt;strong>every person has inherent dignity and worth&lt;/strong>. Our vision is that &lt;strong>no one will spend a single night unsheltered and alone&lt;/strong> during the winter months in Cache Valley. We are committed to ensuring that every person in our community has access to the support and care they need to stay safe during the cold weather season.&lt;/p>
